#  Kadaneâ€™s Algorithm â€” Assignment 2

> *Efficient implementation and analysis of Kadaneâ€™s Algorithm (Maximum Subarray Problem)*

---

## Overview
This project implements **Kadaneâ€™s Algorithm** to find the **maximum subarray sum** in an integer array.  
The work follows **Assignment 2: Algorithmic Analysis and Peer Review**, focusing on:
- Clean, optimized Java implementation
- Complexity and performance analysis
- Unit testing and benchmarking
- Git-based version control with meaningful commits

## Algorithm Logic

Kadaneâ€™s Algorithm efficiently computes the largest contiguous subarray sum in **O(n)** time:

```
for (int i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
    currentMax = Math.max(arr[i], currentMax + arr[i]);
    maxSoFar = Math.max(maxSoFar, currentMax);
}
```
##### It only requires constant memory (O(1)) and a single pass through the array.

### How to Run
#### Compile and Test
```
mvn clean compile
mvn test
```
#### Run CLI Benchmark
```
java -cp target/assignment2_Kadanes_Algorithm-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar cli.BenchmarkRunner
```
#### Run JMH Performance Benchmark
```terminal
mvn package
java -jar target/benchmarks.jar
```
---
#### Example Output
```
Input: [-2, 1, -3, 4, -1, 2, 1, -5, 4]
Max Subarray Sum = 6
```

### Complexity Analysis
```
Case	Time	Space	Description
Best	Î˜(n)	O(1)	Single traversal (all positive or all negative)
Average	Î˜(n)	O(1)	One-pass dynamic computation
Worst	Î˜(n)	O(1)	Always linear traversal
```

##### Linear time, constant space â€” optimal for this problem.

## ðŸ“ˆ Performance Plots

### n vs Comparisons (Complex)

This plot shows **the number of comparisons** performed by Kadaneâ€™s Algorithm for different input sizes and array types:

- Random
- Sorted
- Nearly Sorted
- Reversed

Each point is the **average of 5 trials**, with error bars showing standard deviation.

![n vs Comparisons Complex](docs/performance-plots/n_vs_comparisons_complex.png)

**Observation:**  
Comparisons grow linearly with input size for all array types, confirming the theoretical **O(n)** time complexity. Slight variations are observed due to array order.

---

### n vs Execution Time (Complex)

This graph shows Kadaneâ€™s Algorithm **execution time** for different input sizes and array types:
- Random
- Sorted
- Nearly Sorted
- Reversed

Each point is the **average of 5 trials** with error bars representing standard deviation.

![n vs Execution Time Complex](docs/performance-plots/n_vs_execution_time_complex.png)

**Observation:**  
The algorithm remains linear (**O(n)**) for all input types. Execution times slightly differ depending on array order, but asymptotic complexity is consistent.
